        <h3>Rules of Play:</h3>
        <h5>Regular Pig</h5>
        <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
            <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
            <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>
        <p>For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, 
            but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, 
            but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. 
            The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-6, after which she chooses to hold, 
            and adds her turn total of 23 points to her score. </p>

        <h3>Another Variation:</h3>
        <h5>Two-Dice Pig</h5>
        <p>The game can be played with a pair of dice instead of one</p>
        <p>This variation is the same as Pig, except:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total.</li>
            <li>If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.</li>
            <li>If two 1s are rolled, the player's entire score is lost, and the turn ends.</li>
            <li>If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as with any roll but the player is obligated to roll again (possible sub-variation of the two-dice game)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some versions of this game instead use 6 as the "bad" die face.</p>
